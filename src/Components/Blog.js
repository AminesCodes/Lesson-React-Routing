      <h1>The Cell Phone</h1>
      <p>
        A couple of months ago, my friend’s cousin (a single mother) bought a
        new cell phone. After a long day of work, she came home, placed her
        phone on the counter, and went watch to TV; her son came to her and
        asked if he could play with her new phone. She told him not to call
        anyone or mess with text messages, and he agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
        At around 11:20, she was drowsy, so she decided to tuck her son in and
        go to bed. She walked to his room and saw that he wasn’t there. She then
        ran over to her room to find him sleeping on her bed with the phone in
        his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relieved, she picked her phone back up from his hand to inspect it.
        Browsing through it, she noticed only minor changes such as a new
        background, banner, etc., but then she opened up her saved pictures. She
        began deleting the pictures he had taken, until only one new picture
        remained.
      </p>
      <p>
        When she first saw it, she was in disbelief. It was her son sleeping on
        her bed, but the picture was taken by someone else above him... and it
        showed the left half of an elderly woman’s face.
